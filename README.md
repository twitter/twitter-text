# twitter-text

This repository is a collection of libraries and conformance tests to standardize parsing of Tweet text. It synchronizes development, testing, creating issues, and pull requests for twitter-text's implementations and specification. These libraries are responsible for determining the quantity of characters in a Tweet and identifying and linking any URL, @username, #hashtag, or $cashtag.

See implementations and conformance in this repository below:

* [Conformance](conformance)

* [Ruby](rb)
* [JavaScript](js)
* [Objective-C](objc)
